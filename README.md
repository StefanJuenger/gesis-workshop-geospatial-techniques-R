## Workshop Description
When social scientists aim to use geospatial data, they must rely on specialized tools, called Geographic Information Systems (GIS). However, the world of GIS is complicated, since often only foreign software solutions provide a comprehensive collection of available geospatial techniques. Fortunately, nowadays, social scientists can also use the statistical software R as a proper GIS. Thus, this course will teach how to exploit R and apply its geospatial techniques in a social science context. We will learn about the most common data formats, their quirks, and their application. Most importantly, the course will present data sources, how to get the data and wrangle them for further analysis.  Central are geospatial operations, such as cropping, aggregating or linking data. Finally, what is of interest for many researchers is creating maps, which is also straightforward in R.
