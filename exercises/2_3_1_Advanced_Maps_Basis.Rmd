Let us go back to where we stopped developing our mapping techniques yesterday: Our Covid-19 Map.
This is just a super short repetition of what was just presented.
No worries, we're going to have some time to improve your maps in the second exercise.


```{block, box.title = "1", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}

Recreate a simple Covid-19 map as already created yesterday but use ggplot2 this time.

They don't have to match perfectly but:

  - Use either the cases per 100.000 inhabitants or cases per 100.000 inhabitants in the last seven days.
  - Choose a color palette.
  - Name your legend and change its position.
  - Your map should have a title.
  
```

```{r code}

# For importing the data, you can use this code:
library(dplyr)
library(sf)

attributes_districts <-  read.csv("../data/attributes_districts.csv", 
                                  header = T, fill = T, sep = ",") 

german_districts_enhanced <- st_read(dsn = "../data",
                           layer = "GER_DISTRICTS") %>% 
                           rename(., district_id = id) %>% 
                          st_transform(., crs = 3035) %>% 
                          left_join(., attributes_districts, by = "district_id")



```


```{r first-exercise, solution = TRUE}

# load libraries
library(ggplot2)


# build map
covid_map <-
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = german_districts_enhanced, 
          aes(fill = cases_per_100k), 
          color = NA) + 
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "plasma",
                       direction = -1,
                       name = "Covid-19 Cases per 100k") + 
  theme(legend.position = "left") +
  labs(title="Covid-19 Map",   
       subtitle= "German Federal Elections 2017")   

covid_map


```

```{block, box.title = "2", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}

Save your map as a `.pdf`!

```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}

You need the function `ggsave` to fulfill this task.

```

```{r second-exercise, solution = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

# save map
ggsave("./own_material/covid_map.pdf", covid_map, dpi = 300)

```


```{block, box.title = "3", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}

Now we want to add another layer to see if enough hospitals are located in the Covid-19 high-risk zones of Germany.

- Add the hospital layer to the map
- Change the color of the points

For an extra challenge which we haven't covered: The hospital shapefile contains information on the number of beds in each hospital. Can you change the size of hospital dots according to the number of beds?


```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}

Make sure that the CRS of your hospital layer is defined correctly! 

```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}

You need to define `size = beds` as the aesthetics of the new layer.

```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}

The variable beds is a character but need to be numeric.

```


```{r third-exercise, solution = TRUE}

# import point layer hospital sf
hospitals_sf <- read.csv("../data/hospital_points.csv", header = T, fill = T, sep = ",") %>%
                st_as_sf(., coords = c("X", "Y"),
                  crs = 3035)
                
# add hospital layer to map
covid_hospitals_map <-
  ggplot() +
   geom_sf(data = german_districts_enhanced, 
          aes(fill = cases_per_100k), 
          color = NA) + 
   scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "plasma",
                       direction = -1,
                       name = "Covid-19 Cases per 100k") + 
    theme(legend.position = "left") +
    labs(title="Covid-19 Map") +
            # add hospital layer
    geom_sf(data = hospitals_sf,
            # define the size of the hospital layer 
            # by the number of beds
         aes(size = as.numeric(beds)))

covid_hospitals_map

```
