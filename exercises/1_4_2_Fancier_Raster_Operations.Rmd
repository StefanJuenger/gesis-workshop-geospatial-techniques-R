```{block, box.title = "1", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Sample 50 points that fall within the boundaries of the city of Cologne. You will find the shapefile in the `./data/` folder.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
The shapefile is no raster file, so that you would need the `sf::read_sf()` function to load the data. Sampling is straightforward: Apply the `sf::st_sample` to the loaded shapefile, but make sure to apply the `sf::st_as_sf()` function afterward to receive a full-fledged data table (with a geometry column only).
```

```{r first, solution = TRUE}
library(dplyr)

cologne <-
  sf::read_sf("../data/cologne.shp")

cologne_50_points <-
  cologne %>% 
  sf::st_sample(50) %>% 
  sf::st_as_sf()
```


```{block, box.title = "2", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Create a new raster layer comprising Cologne's immigrant rates based on the raster layers from the previous exercises.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
You would need the `immigrants_cologne.tif` and `inhabitants_cologne.tif` files in the `./data/` folder.
```

```{r second, solution = TRUE}
library(raster)

immigrant_rates <-
  raster::raster("../data/immigrants_cologne.tif") * 100 /
  raster::raster("../data/inhabitants_cologne.tif")
```

```{block, box.title = "3", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Extract the immigrant rate value at each position of the previously sampled points as a vector. What is your observation?
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
Remember that the German Census 2011 data are relatively sparse due to some severe data protection measures.
```

```{r third, solution = TRUE}
immigrant_rates_at_point <-
  raster::extract(immigrant_rates, cologne_50_points)

# There may be a lot of missing values.
```

```{block, box.title = "4", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Use an adequate method of raster extraction to gather information in the geographic surrounding of a point. What is your observation now?
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
Assume that people move in a 500 meters radius around their location. Thus, extracting information on buffers of 500 meters around the points might be interesting using the option `buffer = 500`. In that case, you should also set a descriptive statistics function, e.g., with the option `fun = mean`. 
```

```{r fourth, solution = TRUE}
immigrant_rates_500m_buffer <-
  raster::extract(immigrant_rates, cologne_50_points, buffer = 500, fun = mean)

# There may be a lot of missing values.
```
