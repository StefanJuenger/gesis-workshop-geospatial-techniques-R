We've finally arrived at creating our first maps based on the data we imported and cleaned in the previous sessions.
The focus on this first session lies on the package `tmap` to create maps.


```{block, box.title = "1", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}

Let's start super simple.
Import our enhanced district data.
Create a map with the outline of Germany and one were the borders of the districts are visible.
Chose a color of your choice for both maps.

```

```{r first.exercise, solution = TRUE}

# load libraries
library(tmap)
library(sf)
library(dplyr)

# code based on the original
german_districts <- st_read(dsn = "../data",
                           layer = "GER_DISTRICTS") %>% 
                     rename(., district_id = id)

attributes_districts <-  read.csv("../data/attributes_districts.csv", 
                                  header = T, fill = T, sep = ",") 
                                  
german_districts_enhanced <- 
        german_districts %>% 
        left_join(., attributes_districts, by = "district_id") %>% 
        st_transform(., crs = 3035)


# start by setting the tmap mode to "plot" for static maps
tmap_mode("plot")   # interactive maps can be designed by changing the mode to "view"

# first maps based on geometrc features
tm_shape(german_districts_enhanced) + # call  the shapefile first
  tm_fill(col = "lightgrey") # fills the polygons without drawing borders

# ... or use tm_polygons
tm_shape(german_districts_enhanced) + 
  tm_polygons(col = "lightblue") # fills the polygons and draws borders


```

```{block, box.title = "2", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}

In a second step, we want to visualize some information on the German districts contained in the attribute table.
Choose the column  and create a map of Covid-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in Germany.
Alternate the map by:

- add a legend title and change the color palette
- add a title to the map and change the font color of the title
- place the legend outside to of the map at the bottom
- ...

Assign your map to an object called `covid_map`.

```

```{r second-exercise, solution = TRUE}

# plot the covid-19 cases per 100.000 inhabitants
tm_shape(german_districts_enhanced) + 
  tm_fill(col = "cases_per_100k")                   # "col" can be the name of a color or a column name

# change the title of the legend and the color palette
tm_shape(german_districts_enhanced) + 
  tm_fill(col = "cases_per_100k",
              title = "Covid-19 Cases per 100k",    # add a title to the legend
              palette = "RdPu")                     # change the color palette

# add a title in the color blue
tm_shape(german_districts_enhanced) + 
  tm_fill(col = "cases_per_100k",
              title = "Covid-19 Cases per 100k",
              palette = "RdPu") +
  tm_layout(title = "Covid Cases in Germany",        # alternate the overall layout like title
            title.color = "blue" )                   # changes the font color of the title

# place the legend outside of the map to the left
tm_shape(german_districts_enhanced) + 
  tm_fill(col = "cases_per_100k",
              title = "Covid-19 Cases per 100k",
              palette = "RdPu") +
  tm_layout(title = "Covid Cases in Germany",
            title.color = "blue" ) +
  tm_legend(legend.outside = TRUE,                  # positions the legend outside           
            legend.outside.position = "left")       # defines legend positions 

# save your map in an object called "covid_map"
covid_map <-  
  tm_shape(german_districts_enhanced) + 
  tm_fill(col = "cases_per_100k",
              title = "Covid-19 Cases per 100k",
              palette = "RdPu") +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Covid Cases in Germany",
            main.title.color = "blue" ) +
  tm_legend(legend.outside = TRUE,
            legend.outside.position = "left") 


```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}

Check the `head()` of your shapefile. 
You might to need to rename some of the columns or use the correct names: `cases_per_100k` (abbreviated: `cs__100`).

```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}

Combine following options with a plus sign:

- add a legend title and change the color palette: `tm_fill(col = "", title = "", palette = "") +`
- add a title to the map and change the font color of the title: `tm_layout(title = "", title.color = "") +`
- place the legend outside: `tm_legend(legend.outside = T/N, legend.outside.position = "")`

If you run `colors()`, R returns the names of all built-in colors.

```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}

To assign your map to an object use the arrow `<-`.

```
